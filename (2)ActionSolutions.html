                            <h1>Tuberculosis (TB)</h1>
                    <p> is a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs. The germs that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria. Tuberculosis can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or sings. This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air. </p>
                 <h2> Action and Solution: <br> </h2>
              <h3> <span> Prevention </span> </h3>
            <p> Seek medical attention if you have symptoms like prolonged cough, fever and unexplained weight loss as early treatment for TB can help stop the spread of disease and improve your chances of recovery.
            </p>
            <p> Get tested for TB infection if you are at increased risk, such as if you have HIV or are in contact with people who have TB in your household or your workplace. 
            </p>
            <p>
            If prescribed treatment to prevent TB, complete the full course. 
            <br>
            If you have TB, practice good hygiene when coughing, including avoiding contact with other people and wearing a mask, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of sputum and used tissues properly.
            </p>
              <p> Special measures like respirators and ventilation are important to reduce infection in healthcare and other institutions. 
               </p>
               <h3> <span> Treatment </span> </h3>
                   <p> This can be treated with antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease.
                       The most common antibiotics used are:
                    <p>
                    - isoniazid <br>
                    - rifampin  <br>
                    - pyrazinamide  <br>
                    - ethambutol  <br>
                    - streptomycin </br>
                    </p>
                    <p> To be effective, these medications need to be taken daily for 4–6 months. It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice. This can allow TB that is still alive to become resistant to the drugs.
                    Tuberculosis that doesn’t respond to standard drugs is called drug-resistant TB and requires more toxic treatment with different medicines.
                    </p>

                            <h1>Malaria</h1>
                         <p> is an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable. 
                         </p>
                     <h2>Action and Solution: <br> </h2>
                 <h3> <span> Medications </span> </h3>
             <p> When planning to travel to an area where malaria occurs, talk with your doctor well in advance of your departure. 
             </p>
             <p> Drugs to prevent malaria can be prescribed for travelers to malarious areas, but travelers from different countries may receive different recommendations, reflecting differences in treatment protocols as well as availability of medicines in different countries. Travelers visiting only cities or rural areas where there is no risk of malaria may not require preventive drugs, but an exact itinerary is necessary to determine what degree of protection may be needed.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are several medications recommended for prevention of malaria in travelers. Determining which medication is best depends on several factors, such as your medical history and the amount of time before your scheduled departure. Strict adherence to the recommended doses and schedules of the antimalarial drug selected is necessary for effective protection.
             <br>
             <h3> <span> Protection from the mosquitoes </span> </h3>
              <p> Be aware that you are still at risk for malaria even with the use of protection.
                        To avoid mosquito bites, the CDC recommends the following:
                        - Apply insect repellent to exposed skin. The recommended repellent contains 20-35% percent N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). <br>
                        - Wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants if you are outdoors at night.<br>
                        - Use a mosquito net over the bed if your bedroom is not air-conditioned or screened. For additional protection, treat the mosquito net with the insecticide permethrin. <br>
                        - Spray an insecticide or repellent on clothing, as mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing. <br>
                        - Spray pyrethrin or a similar insecticide in your bedroom before going to bed. <br>
              </p>

            <h2>Action and Solution: <h2> 

            <h3> <span> Keep Yourself and others safe </span> </h3>
            <p>
                - Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination. <br>
                - Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact. <br>
                - Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings. <br>
                - Clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. <br>
                - Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands regularly. <br>
                - If you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover. <br>
            </p>
            <h3> <span> Wear a mask properly </span> </h3>
            <p> - Make sure your mask covers your nose, mouth and chin. <br>
                - Clean your hands before you put your mask on, before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time. <br>
                - When you take off your mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask or dispose of it in a trash bin if it’s a medical mask. <br>
                - Don’t use masks with valves.

            <h1>HIV</h1>
                <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the body’s immune system. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the most advanced stage of the disease.
                    HIV targets the body’s white blood cells, weakening the immune system. This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis, infections and some cancers.
                    HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby.</p>
                    <p>Action and Solution: </p>
                        <h3> <span> Prevention </span> </h3>
                    <p> HIV is a preventable disease.
                        Reduce the risk of HIV infection by: <br>
                     - using a male or female condom during sex
                     - being tested for HIV and sexually transmitted infections
                     - having a voluntary medical male circumcision
                     - using harm reduction services for people who inject and use drugs.
                    </p>
                     <p> Doctors may suggest medicines and medical devices to help prevent HIV, including:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     - antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), including oral PrEP and long acting products
                     - dapivirine vaginal rings
                     - injectable long acting cabotegravir.
                     - ARVs can also be used to prevent mothers from passing HIV to their children.
                    <p>
                     People taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. Access to testing and ART is an important part of preventing HIV.
                    </p>
                    <p>Treatment </p> <br>
                    <p>
                    There is no cure for HIV infection. <br> It is treated with antiretroviral drugs, which stop the virus from replicating in the body.
                    Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a person’s immune system to get stronger. This helps them to fight other infections.
                    <p>
                    Currently, ART must be taken every day for the rest of a person’s life.
                    ART lowers the amount of the virus in a person’s body. This stops symptoms and allows people to live a full and healthy life. People living with HIV who are taking ART and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not spread the virus to their sexual partners.
                    Pregnant women with HIV should have access to and take ART as soon as possible. This protects the health of the mother and will help prevent HIV from passing to the fetus before birth, or to the baby through breast milk.
                    Antiretroviral drugs given to people without HIV can prevent the disease.
                    When given before possible exposures to HIV it is called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and when given after an exposure it is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).  People can use PrEP or PEP when the risk of contracting HIV is high; people should seek advice from a clinician when thinking about using PrEP or PEP.
                    Advanced HIV disease remains a persistent problem in the HIV response. WHO is supporting countries to implement the advanced HIV disease package of care to reduce illness and death. Newer HIV medicines and short course treatments for opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis are being developed that may change the way people take ART and prevention medicines, including access to injectable formulations, in the future.

            <h1> Dengue </h1>
            <p> Dengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates.
                Most people who get dengue won’t have symptoms. But for those that do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most will also get better in 1–2 weeks. Some people develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital. 
                In severe cases, dengue can be fatal.  
                You can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites especially during the day.
                Dengue is treated with pain medicine as there is no specific treatment currently.
            <h2>Action and Solution: <h2> 
            <h3> <span> Symptoms </span> </h3> 
                <p>Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    If symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include:
                    
                    - high fever (40°C/104°F)
                    - severe headache
                    - pain behind the eyes
                    - muscle and joint pains
                    - nausea
                    - vomiting
                    - swollen glands
                    - rash. 
                    - Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue.
                    <br>
                    Severe dengue symptoms often come after the fever has gone away:
                    
                    - severe abdominal pain
                    - persistent vomiting
                    - rapid breathing
                    - bleeding gums or nose 
                    - fatigue
                    - restlessness
                    - blood in vomit or stool
                    - being very thirsty
                    - pale and cold skin
                    - feeling weak.
                    <br>
                    People with these severe symptoms should get care right away. 
                    
                    After recovery, people who have had dengue may feel tired for several weeks.
